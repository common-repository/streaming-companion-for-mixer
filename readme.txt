== Version 1.2 Released! == 
VOD Embedding from Mixer has finally been released!!! So, updated the code so you get a full Embedded Vod experience. (Had to load up a portable version of mixer previously just to get vods to work... NO MORE!) 

== Summary ==

This plugin is a modification of StreamWeasels & j.burleigh1's project: Broadcast Companion, which can be found over at https://wordpress.org/plugins/broadcast-companion/ or in full over at https://www.streamweasels.com for the entire package, both free and paid.

It is for use with the Broadcast theme and provides the mixer.com API functionality instead of the Twitch.tv API.

This plugin is not being sold to you, it is provided to you absolutely free of charge with NO HIDDEN CATCH OR FEE. The Theme in which accompanies this plugin however, I must forward you over to Stream Weasels.
Finally, If this plugin is being sold to you by anyone other than Stream Weasels or j.burleigh1, then i would suggest you make a fraudulent claim A.S.A.P With your banking institution or paypal.
